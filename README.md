# Advent of Code 2020
_"Dust off my Rust!"_

## Goal
This year, I'd like to finish out the Advent of Code using the Rust Programming language! I'm making this repo public as an accountability measure and a way to get feedback on my Rust and solutioning!

## Disclaimer
I'm doing most of these solutions in whatever free time I findâ€“ don't expect too much from my _very_ MVP solutions. If I find time to do better than "brute forcing" a problem, I certainly will. That said, any constructive feedback or pointers are quite welcome!
