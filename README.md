# Advent of Code 2020
_"Dust off my Rust!"_

## Goal
This year, I'd like to finish out the Advent of Code using the Rust Programming language (_as much as time allows_)! I'm making this repo public as an accountability measure and a way to get feedback on my Rust and solution-ing! The priorities are as follows:
1. Complete at least part 1 in every challenge in any language by end-of-day Dec 25 and all parts by Dec 30th
2. Do at least part 1 of every challenge in Rust by Dec 30th

## Disclaimers
I'm doing most of these solutions in whatever free time I findâ€“ don't expect too much from my _very_ MVP solutions. If I find time to do better than "brute forcing" a problem, I certainly will. That said, any constructive feedback or pointers are quite welcome! 

If you're seeing a day that only has a JavaScript solution, that means I haven't gotten around to implementing it in Rust yet but didn't want to leave off doing the challenge because I didn't have the time to do it in Rust.
